It is advisable for us to follow coaches ( \u003d instructors) on social media, such as through videos on Facebook or YouTube. I believe this could help members not only practice effectively but also stay motivated. Moreover, I suggest finding an expert who has a lot of knowledge and experience in the health area to support members during this time. By implementing these new strategies, the experience of our members can be improved. As a result, we can attract more people to join our club. \r\nI hope my suggestions will be useful.\r\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\r\nBest regards,\r\nHenry.",
