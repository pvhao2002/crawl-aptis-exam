This tight schedule makes it impossible for me to join in the park cleaning. I work all week, and the only time I go out is on weekends with my family. We usually visit the park to play games and take a walk. I am relieved to hear that the park will be cleaned by the children volunteering from the school nearby.

Cleaning the local park not only helps keep the environment clean but also teaches kids the value of teamwork and dedication.

All members are welcome to give their opinions on the benefits of debating topical issues.\r\nFirstly, debating helps improve critical thinking skills. This is essential for young people as it teaches them how to analyze different viewpoints and make informed decisions. Secondly, public speaking boosts confidence. This skill is valuable not only in debates but also in many aspects of life, including job interviews and presentations. Therefore, to encourage new members, we could organize fun workshops or events that highlight these benefits. I believe this would show them how engaging and rewarding debating can be. By implementing these changes, we can ensure better attendance and engagement of our club members, enhancing the overall experience for everyone involved.\r\nThank you for considering my suggestions!\r\nBest regards,\r\nLeo",
