Many people say you should sleep at fixed hours to get enough rest, but that isn’t always necessary according to science.

Another common belief is that you should always sleep on a bed instead of a hard floor, but this is questionable. \u003cstrong\u003eWhat everyone agrees on, and what studies show, is that blocking out light and noise can help improve sleep quality.\u003c/strong\u003e Darkness helps our body produce melatonin, which is the hormone that makes us feel sleepy, while silence allows us to rest better.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSome say that sleep is getting worse for people today, but there is no solid proof to support this claim.

          "vanbangiaithich": "For many people, playing games is for children, not for adults. They believe it is a waste of time and not a productive way to spend their day. For me, I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. I enjoy playing games because it helps me to relax and reduce stress after a long working day. It\u0026rsquo;s a fun way to unwind, and sometimes it even helps me think more creatively. I believe that gaming can be beneficial, as long as it is done in moderation. Everyone has different ways to relax, and playing games is just one of them. Plus, many games can improve problem-solving skills and reaction time, which are useful in daily life. That\u0027s why I find value in playing games as part of my routine.",

          "vanbangiaithich": "Regarding the first question, let me tell you about a time I learned something new, and it was when I traveled to Da Nang city. Da Nang is famous for its beaches, and one of them is My Khe, which is one of the most wonderful beaches in the world. Every year, there are many tourists going to the area to see the beauty of the beach. Therefore, going to this city was extremely expensive for me at that time. However, the experience was worth every penny as I got to enjoy the stunning views and vibrant atmosphere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the trip, I learned new things about the culture here, which really surprised me. I love what I have learned, especially about the local cuisine and traditions. So in Da Nang, I did a number of things. First of all, I did some sightseeing in the mountains, and I had a beautiful view of the city below. I also visited historical sites that gave me a deeper understanding of the area\u0027s rich history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTurning to the second question, I usually feel really happy when I learn something new because I can expand my knowledge and experience. Each new lesson adds a layer to my understanding of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for the final question, I agree that it is never too old to learn new things because knowledge is unlimited. Moreover, many people love to explore new things, and this curiosity keeps life exciting and fulfilling. I believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and we should always embrace opportunities to grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, meeting new people during my travels often leads to interesting discussions that further enhance my learning. Each encounter opens my mind to different perspectives and ideas, making my experiences even more enriching.",
