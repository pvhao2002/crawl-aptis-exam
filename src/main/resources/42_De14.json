Moreover, by adding a category for those under 16, we’re showing a commitment to developing young talents, which could increase interest in our club.  By implementing these changes, we can ensure better attendance and engagement, enhancing the overall experience for everyone involved.\r\nI hope my suggestions will be useful.\r\nI am looking forward to hearing from you soon.\r\nBest regards,\r\nHanna.",
