The prices are reasonable, and the food is good and varied. My favorite part is the starters – there are so many things that I don’t know what to choose from. My only criticism is the noise level. The live show was excellent, but the volume was a bit low; they should turn it up next time.

The staff wasn’t friendly at all, and while the meal was huge, it made me question whether that was a good sign. The traditional style of the food didn’t match the modern décor, creating an odd experience that I don’t want to repeat.
