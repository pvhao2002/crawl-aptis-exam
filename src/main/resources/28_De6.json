This is not an easy question to answer. Sports are often understood as inherently competitive, which makes it debatable whether they are good or bad. However, when the competitive element is excluded, sports play a crucial role in children’s development. They provide opportunities for socializing and learning essential life skills that are not typically taught in the classroom, such as teamwork, communication, and resilience. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn the other hand, competitive sports can have negative effects.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan xss\u003dremoved\u003e By this, I mean that constantly comparing one child to another to determine who is better or worse can be harmful.
